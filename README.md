## **Description**
This project demonstrates how I would refactor HTML and CSS code and improve a site's performance, accessibility, and SEO. Changes to Horiseon's landing page include:

* **Improvements to HTML**
    * Changed many div tags to more descriptive tags (header, section, etc.) to make code clearer
    * Used better spacing to visually separate areas of code
    * Added comments to describe code purpose

* **Improvements to CSS**
    * Changed order of rules to match flow of HTML code
    * Grouped rules together to remove redundant/repetitive code
    * Added flexbox responsiveness to the header/navigation
    * Added comments to describe code purpose

* **Improvements to Performance**
    * Resized images
    * Added exact image sizes to the code

* **Improvements to Acessibility**
    * Added alt attributes to all images
    * Adjusted site colors (within the same color families) to increase contrast, making the text more readable

* **Improvements to SEO**
    * Added a page title to the head
    * Added a meta description to the head
    * Added a viewport meta tag to the head

**Final Version**
